##  Assumptions Made

- Email and course code are both unique (handled with 409 Conflict).
- A student can't register to the same course twice.
- A student can only drop a course they are registered in.
- There are no seat limits on courses.
- In-memory storage only â€” no external DB used.
- DTOs and validations are used with `@Valid`, `@Email`, `@NotBlank`.
- HTTP status codes follow REST standards:  
  `400`, `404`, `409`, and `500` (fallback).

---

## Code Structure

- **Controller:** Handles REST API endpoints  
- **Service:** Business logic, validation, and in-memory storage  
- **DTOs:** Input/output data transfer objects  
- **Models:** Internal domain models  
- **Exception:** Custom error handling  
- **Config:** Swagger OpenAPI setup
